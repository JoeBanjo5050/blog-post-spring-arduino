# blog-post-spring-arduino

This project is founded on a deprecated GitHub Spring Boot project designed to control a turret via a RESTful web service capable of receiving JSON POST requests in order to relay serialized commands to an Arduino Uno, which I have retooled using Spring Initializer and am in the midst of building additional features. Much thanks and credit to the original content creator Milosz Orzel, whom has also added my fork to the original project link README.md, as a currently functioning update.
